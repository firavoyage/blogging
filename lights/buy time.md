First, realize that you're probably making at least double the median US income. If you have a house with no loan and that income, you're doing way, way, way better than average.
I see two possible paths forward.

The less likely is to read and internalize https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/ and realize how quickly you can reach financial independence at a reduced spending level (but one that still affords an amazing life). Buying time is the most valuable use of money, IMO.

The second is to stay miserable for a while, striving for something ambiguous yet out of reach, until you get older and this feeling fades.

Path #1 (or a variant) is probably healthier and happier.
