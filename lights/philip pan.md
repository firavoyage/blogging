今天，我听说有一本 2008 年 6 月的新书，受到广泛的好评。

上个星期，美国公共电视台 PBS 对作者进行了专访（[视频](http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/08222008/watch3.html)，[文字稿](http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/08222008/transcript3.html)，[MP3](http://www.pbs.org/moyers/rss/media/BMJ-1219.mp3)），内容关于他的新书，以及如何看待今天的中国。

这个采访很值得一看。我认为，Philip Pan 对中国的情况非常了解，而且有清醒的认识，谈到了许多根本的和重大的判断。

比如，主持人问："对于中国的内部事务，美国能够做什么？"

他回答：

> "That's a very tough question. ...There is a concern, and I think a legitimate concern, that the more we push for change, we, meaning the United States government pushes for change in China, the more of a backlash there is by the hardliners. It gives the people in power who want to resist change, an excuse to, and it gives them not only an excuse, but it gives them an enemy. They can use this to rally the public, this is another reason they've been so successful."

（插一句，这篇日志中的英语部分，我不翻译了，只提供原文。最近，我每次张贴与政治相关的内容，都会有无数"爱国青年"跳出来，对我"教育"一番，或者辱骂一番。我已经有点厌倦了。所以这一次，请你们看懂英语以后，再来发言吧。）

主持人问：为什么中国政府甘愿不惜成本，一定要成功举办奥运会？

他回答：

> Part of the answer is that the priority isn't really with the Olympics. Their priority really isn't the west. They want to use this Olympics to send a message to their own people, most of all. They want to demonstrate to the Chinese people that their government is legitimate, that it has been successful, and that world approves of the government.
>
> And when I say "this government", I mean the one-party system, in effect. You know, communism as an ideology is dead, essentially. But the Communist Party needs something to justify its continuing rule. And using the Olympics was part of their strategy, I think.
>
> They're worried about what the Chinese people think of the Party. They don't want the Chinese people to know that there are other voices. They want to present a united front, that this is an effective government, that everyone is happy with it, that this political system, a one-party political system merged with capitalism, can be just as effective as a democratic system in the west. And they want their people to believe that.

主持人问：既然中国的制度已经变成非常彻底的资本主义，为什么这个党还自称为共产党？

他回答：

> I've asked them that. They have long answers about ideology and all that, how this capitalism is only a temporary phase, that they're using this to achieve real communism. But there are aspects of the political system, I think, that recall communism. I don't know if it's the communism that Marx might have envisioned. But it's still a one-party state. They still have a propaganda bureau. They still control the press and the television stations and the radio stations.
>
> They're not willing to let go of that legacy.They need that in order to stay in power. They're worried that if they allowed checks on the market forces, that if they allowed workers to organize, that their own political power would be threatened.

上面的回答妙！我都没想到这一点。

我觉得，整篇访问中，最精彩的还是下面这一段：

> BILL MOYERS: What you describe is a fusion of capitalism and authoritarianism that can resemble a mafia organization. That's a criminal enterprise.
>
> PHILIP PAN: It is a criminal enterprise, in parts of the country.
>
> BILL MOYERS: The government?
>
> PHILIP PAN: The government. ... They've been able to manage patriotism and shift that into nationalist support for the party. You know, if you love your country, you must love this political system. You must love this party, as well. And they've been able to do that.

Captalism + Authoritarianism = Mafia，难道不是吗？
