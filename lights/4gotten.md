### The 4Gotten generation: An open letter to India’s youth: Get off that smartphone. It can destroy you

October 24, 2020, 7:28 AM IST Chetan Bhagat in The Underage Optimist

Dear friends,

I don’t know if this letter will even reach you, despite being published in a big newspaper. Many of you are so busy with your phones, watching videos, playing video games, chatting with your friends, commenting on social media, or just scrolling through the feeds of beautiful celebrities, reading an article falls way down on the priority list.

However, if you do happen to chance on this, please read this fully. This is important and this is about your life. You are wasting your life on your phone. Yes, you are the first young generation in India’s history that has access to smartphones and cheap data, and you are spending hours on it, every day.

Check your screen time, which often averages 5-7 hours a day for young people. Retired or established people can spend so many hours on their devices. A young person, who has to build his/ her life, just can’t.

Chad Crowe
Five hours is one-third of your productive waking hours, or one-third of your life. Like cigarettes or other drugs, this phone addiction is eating away a part of your life. It’s damaging your career prospects and messing up your brain. If it stays this way, your entire generation will become a 4Gotten generation, an entire generation addicted to 4G, aimless in their life and clueless about the nation.

These are the top three negative effects of this phone addiction.

Number one, of course, is the absolute waste of time, which could be utilised on more productive things in life. Imagine saving three hours a day from your phone, and spending it on anything – fitness, learning a skill, studying more, a more intense job search, opening a business. Imagine if you did this consistently, where it would take you.

Two, watching mindless stuff dulls your cognitive brain. Our brain has two areas – cognitive and emotional. A good mind is where both work well. When you watch junk, the cognitive brain disengages and is used less. You soon lack the ability to think, reason or argue something logically. You can no longer see different points of view, process multiple scenarios, evaluate pros and cons or make the right decisions.

You function with your emotional brain alone as your cognitive brain is numb. The constant anger on social media, the polarisation, the intense fandom and intense hate for celebrities or politicians, the popularity of certain screaming TV anchors all point to a generation where the emotional brain is in control, and the reasoning mind is not engaged.

People who work only with an emotional brain don’t do well in life. The only way out – stop numbing your brain and engage your mind in more productive things.

Three, constant hours on the screen kill your motivation and energy. Success in life comes from setting goals, staying motivated and working hard towards your goals. However, watching a screen makes us lazy. Deep down, a fear of failure sets in as you’re not sure if you can put in the work anymore.

To cope, you try to find a reason why you can’t find success in life. You try to find an enemy – bad current politicians, bad past politicians, Muslims, Bollywood nepotism, rich people, famous people, any villain to be made responsible for your life not being what it could be. Yes, the system is unfair and rigged. However, wasting time venting on social media won’t help you. Working on yourself will.

Stop complaining. Start creating. Create a better life for yourself, and create a better person. Are you doing your maximum? Are you working as hard as you possibly can? Keep that wretched phone away until you make something of your life. Winners find a way out of the unfairness. You can too.

Unlike hard drugs, 4G phones are legal. Kids can keep one in their pocket. The phone is also immensely useful – for information, shopping or online classes. It can be used to grow and learn. But it can also literally destroy a young person’s life, and even an entire generation.

For it’s up to the youth to take India where they want to take it. Imagine the generation that got us Independence. How cool were they? They were out there, fighting to make India free. I still remember the Mandal Commission protests, or the 2011 Anna protests. The youth cared about national issues. Today, does the youth actually care about what truly impacts us? Or do they emotionally react to news based on how sensational, entertaining or crazy it is?

The super important, urgent priority is to make our economy grow again. China is five times richer than us. Google pictures of Chinese cities on the Internet. We have to do so much to get there. Should we focus on that? Or should we outrage over harmless ads that show an inter-religious couple? Should you focus on your career, or should you waste your time on never ending historical Hindu-Muslim issues? You want to build a good life or solve Bollywood conspiracies?

You, the youth of today, will decide the answers to these questions. No leader, no actor, no celebrity will do it for you. Take yourself and this country where you want it to go. Don’t aim to make India poor and proud. Aim to make India and yourself rich and humble. Get off that stupid phone, engage your mind in productive and creative things and make something of your life and country.

Be the generation that 4Ges India ahead. Don’t end up as the 4Gotten generation.

Love,

Chetan Bhagat

亲爱的年轻朋友们，

这封公开信尽管在大报纸上发表，但是我不知道你是否会看到它。你们中的许多人都忙于使用手机，观看视频，玩视频游戏，与朋友聊天，在社交媒体上发表评论，或者只是滚动浏览名人新闻。你们顾不上阅读文章。

但是，如果你碰巧遇到了这篇文章，请完整读完它。这很重要，这关系到你的生活。你正在手机上浪费生命。

你们是印度历史上第一代可以使用智能手机和廉价数据流量的人。你们每天在手机上花费大量时间，对于年轻人来说，每天平均达到 5 到 7 个小时。

五小时是你每天清醒时间的三分之一。就像香烟或其他毒品一样，这种手机成瘾正在吞噬你生命的一部分，损害你的职业前景，并弄乱你的大脑。如果这样下去，整个一代印度年轻人将成为被 4G 毁掉的一代人，这一代人全都沉迷于 4G，他们的生活毫无目标，对国家一无所知。

首先，手机成瘾绝对浪费时间，这些时间本可以用于生活中更具生产力的事物。想象一下，每天从手机上节省三个小时，花在任何其他事情上，比如健身，学习技能，找工作，开办企业。如果你始终如一地这样做，它将带你到何处。

第二，手机成瘾会使大脑变钝。当你观看垃圾时，大脑会放松并且运转较少，你很快将变得缺乏逻辑思考、推理或争论的能力。你将不再看到不同的观点，不再能处理不同的问题、评估利弊或做出正确的决定。

由于大脑麻木，你会变得被情绪主导，出现两极分化的情绪，对名人或政客强烈狂热或强烈仇恨。一代人都变得情绪化，失去理性。

最后，连续三个小时以上玩手机，消磨你的动力和精力。生活中的成功来自于设定目标，保持动力并为实现目标而努力。但是，看着手机屏幕会让你失去动力，每天划着屏幕消磨时间。

年轻人将决定印度的未来。想象一下，让印度独立的那一代年轻人，他们关心国家问题，为解放印度而战。今天，年轻人真的在乎影响国家命运的事情吗？还是更在乎轰动的新闻，忙于对娱乐性事件或疯狂性事情做出情绪性反应？

当务之急是使印度的经济再次增长。中国比我们富裕五倍。请在互联网上搜一下中国城市的照片。为了让印度也这样发展，我们必须做很多事情。我们应该集中精力发展经济，还是继续对那些宗教广告表达愤怒？你应该专注于自己的职业，还是应该将时间浪费在永无止境的印度教－穆斯林的历史问题上？你想过上幸福的生活，还是希望搞清楚宝莱坞明星的各种混乱新闻？

你，今天的年轻人，将决定这些问题的答案。没有其他人会为你做这件事，你必须对自己和这个国家的命运负责。印度的贫穷和强烈的民族情绪并不值得自豪，你们的目标应该是让印度和你自己变得富有而谦虚。放下你的手机，将你的思想投入到那些富有成效和创造力的事情中，为自己的生活和国家做出改变。

你们应该使用 4G 成为印度领先的一代人，而不要最终成为被 4G 毁掉的一代人。

爱你们的，

切坦-巴加特
