# Advice

## Introduction

I'm Vedal, creator of Neuro-sama the AI VTuber on Twitch. Now, I don't think I'm qualified to give you advice but if for some reason you still feel the need to listen to me then I hope this helps you.

## How do I make an AI like Neuro-sama?

I can't give you an exact tutorial because I like my job right now, which is Neuro-sama. However, I can say that the main technology behind Neuro-sama is a large language model (LLM) and if you want to play around with this technology I'd recommend OpenAI. They give you free credits upon signup and there are plenty of tutorials for how to use their API's or probably even their online playground to create a chat bot.

## How do I get started programming?

I can't speak for everyone here, but learning a skill such as programming does take effort. I'm self taught and mostly learned from YouTube tutorials online. I don't think you need a specific book or course or degree to be able to program, although, these certainly can help to teach you if that's what motivates you to learn. Personally however, what motivated me to learn was working on my own projects. When I first started I had to use tutorials to do this but as I learnt I could start working on my own projects independently.

## What language should I learn first?

I don't know. I'm honestly not sure it matters that much. Python might be the easiest to start with although some will argue it's better to learn the fundamentals first before moving onto higher level languages. I think it can be learnt at any point so I don't think the langauge matters too much, but that's just me. The best tools are the ones you know.

## So, where do I start?

Things like this can seem super daunting at first, I don't think it particularly matters exactly where you start but more that you keep at it. If I was in your position I would watch a tutorial on how to create something that interests me. What might be an interesting project is creating an AI Discord chat bot using the OpenAI API, this is something I first did when GPT-3 was released to the public. You can find tutorials for how to do this (or things like this) online so I'd recommend following them to learn! Good luck.
