## Uses

This is a living document of the tools, software, and hardware I use. If there is something missing, reach out to me on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/localhost_5173) and I'll add it.

## Editor + Terminal

### Editor

- **Cursor** \- For a seamless AI-assisted coding experience. Cursur Tab is still undefeated btw.
- **Visual Studio Code** \- Sometimes I get tired of Cursor draining all the RAM so I switch to its origin.
- **Zed** \- To be honest VSCode based editors are fast enough for me, but I just love how Zed looks, and the new ACP integration is really dope.

### Terminal

- **Warp** \- A modern terminal with AI features and great UX.
- **Fish Shell** \- A Unix-like Shell built for people my age.

### Font

- **Maple Mono** \- I'm simply attracted to its curves.
- **Comic Mono** \- If you don't think it's cute, you're probably not my type.

## Software

### Productivity

- **Raycast** \- I mainly use it to launch apps, open emoji picker and frequently do currency conversions as I'm pre-rich.
- **Brave Browser** \- Not ideal but really the best option on the market, would be even better if they remove all the crypto nonsense.
- **[ChatWise](https://chatwise.app/)** \- AI chat app made by the greatest indie hacker since jesus christ, and the only product that's linked to its website on this page.
- **1Password** \- The place where I store all my secrets, literally.
- **LocalSend** \- AirDrop but for everyone.
- **Raindrop.io** \- Cross-platform bookmark app

### Development Tools

- **OrbStack** \- Light-weight Docker GUI for macOS, you're screwed if you're on Windows though.
- **Yaak** \- Open-source Postman alternative.
- **Dataflare** \- Light-weight database explorer.
- **Proxyman/Reqable** \- HTTP debugging proxy with excellent UI, the latter is free btw.

### Design & Media

- **Figma** \- I can't design but I use it anyway.
- **IINA** \- How else can you watch videos of any format?
- **Image2Icon** \- Generate icons in various formats for Windows, macOS, and mobile platforms.
- **CapCut** \- I just use it to cut videos.

### Anime & Manga

- **Animeko** \- Cross-platform apps for anime streaming.
- **Mihon** \- The manga reader I have spent countless nights on.
- **AniList** \- Track your anime/manga progress.

## Tech Stack

### Languages & Frameworks

- **TypeScript** \- My go-to language for most projects. Type safety is essential.
- **Node.js** \- JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **React** \- The front-end framework that nobody really likes but has to use for one reason or another.
- **React Router** \- It just works for SPA, SSR or anything you need for a web app, and it won't drive you insane like Next.js.
- **Better Auth** \- The last auth library you will ever need in your web apps.
- **Astro** \- Great for static sites (and nothing else really).
- **Tauri** \- Build desktop apps with Rust and web technologies.

### Tools & Services

- **Vercel** \- The best deployment platform for serverless and static websites.
- **Cloudflare** \- Vercel but with worse UX, it's cheap so people like it.
- **Tailwind CSS** \- It makes you forget about how CSS works.
- **Prettier** \- An opinionated code formatter but I change it to `semi: false` anyway.
- **Stripe** \- I use it to collect payments for my products, but I'm looking for other options that support Alipay/Wechat Pay too.

### Package Managers

- **pnpm** \- The best all-around package manager for Node.js, the non-flat node_modules structure is a necessity for me.
- **mise** \- Version manager for Node.js, Python, Ocaml and many more.

## Hardware

### Computer

- **MacBook Air 14"** \- M4, 32GB RAM. Apple really cooked with this one, highly recommended.
- **External Monitor** \- LG 4K display for extended screen real estate.

### Hand-held & Wearable

- **iPhone 16** \- I just love small devices and iPhone base model with 6.1-inch display is the cutest thing ever, but the battery really sucks compared to Android phones.
- **Oppo Find X8 Ultra** \- I use it for research purposes in the world of forbidden Japanese manga and South Korean webtoons. It also got a great camera but I don't even go outside.
- **Xiaomi Smart Band 10** \- I bought it for the great battery life and fitness tracking but turns out it doesn't work with Strava.

### Peripherals

- **Nuphy Air75** \- Great keyboard.
- **MX Master 3S** \- Even better mouse.
- **Airpods Pro 2** \- Had to use it as I'm deep in the Apple ecosystem, but the best nonetheless.
- **Oppo Enco Free4 Earphones** \- Airpods for Android, but worse.

This list is constantly evolving as I discover new tools and my workflow changes.
