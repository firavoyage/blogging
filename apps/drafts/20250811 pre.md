write a single page web app. it's a markdown based presentation app. first, the page should be an area, which supports dragging and dropping or pasting or clicking to upload a markdown file. then, the markdown file should be splitting based on headers. each header should be a page. you can import opensource libraries to convert markdown to html and render code blocks.
