# programmer bot

recently i've heard the news
"a virtual programmer fully depended on ai"

nothing special

as the manager
wont explain their ideas clearly

unless
- the program is too simple
- the diagram is similar to real script
- the idea is so detailed

so
ai will never replace human programmers

they can code
but they cant
- read between the lines //infer what manager really means
- adjust the details based on individual preferences
- explain their actual intention //except just numbers and probabilies
