# to my girlfriend

> wtf

at the beginning
he just wanted `waifu`

so he tried to date with some girls
and that's where the jouney began

time flies

finally he got what he wanted

but one day
he realized that 
he wanted `waifu` at first
but ended up receiving `wife`

does he still remember why he loved that girl?

well
that's kind of depressing
