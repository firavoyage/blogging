# words for `pure math`

> when i was a hs student
> i always concluded my mistakes

these mistakes were divided to 3 classes
- `calc` copied a wrong sign or unclear handwriting
- `read carefully` skipped an important message such definition or limitation
- `condiser` a formula or a trick

as the time went by
i found that most of them are quite similar
> some of the mistakes are actually the same

i wondered that this phenomenon could be more common

maybe
the statements and the tricks used in problem solutions
are similar too

so i started this program called `words in pure math`

everytime i try to use a new trick in my solution
i will write it down

as it's known to all that math isnt completed
there's some formula that couldnt be proved
but as hs students
we should only deal with the `normal` problems
others may not be proper for us to learn 

so that doesnt matter

at last
after writing down enough words and tricks
i may achieve the stage of `purity`
> math is simple 
> solving problems are just searching for proper words in a known list

it's not just an idea without implementation
you may open `pure math web app`
and enable `ref` mode
then see what happens
