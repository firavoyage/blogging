# why i love these subjects

nowadays
exam-oriented education is popular
i always get excited or disappointed
determined on the result

actually 
results are based on one's stength and luck
strength are the works you've done before exams
but luck differs between subjects

for example
in math exams 
luck is to understand every problems literally
if one studies hard
only the last problem may be really challenging in thinking
for me
what matters the most is my psy level during the exam:
just calm down and read every word carefully
dont miss anything such as the var-definition,special conditions
or make mistakes in calc

in chinese exams
luck is to get proper problems
in composition part
if i'm facing bad problems
i should write everything around the party
else
i can share philosophy thoughts
in reading part
if i'm facing bad problems
i should infer the mental feeling of the characters
else
i can be more logical
in brief
luck is determined by the teacher who gave the problems

thats why i love math
just coz i can hold my luck in my hand

tests are just used to check everyone s ability
it will never be the ultimate purpose of school life

learning my fav subjects is fun
for example in eng
i can know about foreigners's life
understand songs and poems
in math
i can learn how to classify my knowledge
how to conclude teacher's words
in chinese
i can learn how to explain my opinion clearly
how to infer other's thoughts(wtf that's not logical)
in brief
i can get the ability more important than just exam-oriented knowledge

in other subjects
i can't get anything i actually want
that's just a waste of life
