## abstract

1. why js not ts
2. why fs not js

## why js not ts

numbers,strings,objects
they are
- data const
- data from user input or backend
- variable in alogrithm

for `const`
they are pre-edited in the top of the script
they wont change
so no need to specify the type

for `user` and `server`
classes for each data

for `algo`
functions for each algorithm

> conclusion: type is good but the implementation may not be a programming language

## why fs not js

firascript is just syntax sugar
but that's so sweet
