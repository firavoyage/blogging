i registered my gi account in july 2021
but it wasnt quite fun for me that time

time flew
i picked up my lv1 account in nov 2023

now im lv47
ive got shogun
&
i will get nahida days after

sometimes i wonder why im keen on gi
well
its so different from any games ive played

in gi 
you even dont have to compete with others
you live in your own world but you are not alone
you can still let others come

everyone can find his own interest in gi
- hunt treasure like playing `legend`
- read visual novel like playing `galgame`
- solve puzzles
- play card games
- defeat monsters
- play with the characters you love `xp`
- exploit amazing bugs

as an internet game
- when a player comes to the world
it can offer quite huge contents for him to discover
it has an artifact system for the players who want to improve themselves
- when he fully discovers them & he may feel bored `grass growing time`
there are always something new every month
&
you can play with the beginners

most importantly
it can offer quite a lot gaming hours
```

```
热门游戏几乎都是竞技网游
gi不同。
不需要费尽心思思考如何战胜对手

好友系统
和其他世界的真人聊天
可以把游戏和生活联系起来
扩展世界的边际

至于单机游戏
多是一些休闲小游戏和gal
没有新事物等着玩家发现
久了就淡出视野了

在gi你可以
读小说，解密，聊天，抽卡，打怪，打牌，旅行，xp，卡bug
各种玩家都可以投其所好。

总之
这款游戏无竞技门槛，还可以提供足够的小时数。
