## why you may need this

nowadays most platforms recommend contents based on
- popularity
- cold boot
- sponsorship

some great tools and creators are hidden
while highly commercial ones are seen everywhere

we are changing this

the index includes
  - `tools` apps sites and goods
  - `people` great content creators
  - `news` classify lastest products

features
- instead of an eye-catching ad with a vain slogan
a shot of the product and its description
- no one loves an awkward long list
tags for every item
tree view available
- not just based on my pref
everyone can contribute

## where are the contents from

- popularity chart
- editor handpick
- user comments

## how it works

to profit
it contains some sponsored links

but we maintain our principle
- no philistine links accepted
- be clearly marked `sponsored`
- without ruining the integrity of pages
