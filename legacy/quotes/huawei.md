# criticism against huawei company

## about products
- it's high-end due to its price
so it's normal to be without ads or built-in apps
- as a global large company should be
it should consider everyone equally

## about patriotism
- i dont know what's `serve people heart and soul`
i just know that one may not cater to a server
- i dont know how to make a country better
i just know giving money to another domestic person matters nothing
as the money flows from the ordinary people to the rich
