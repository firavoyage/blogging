# contest

one got 100 points in an ordinary contest

if the contest only contain 100 points
it's hard to figure out his exact ability
(just 100 points or 120 points maybe)

if the contest only contain 110 points
it's still hard
as making small mistakes is human

so the contest may contain 150 points at last

but it's not just a raise of total score
actually it's the difficulty having raised
as his ability of achieving 100 points remains still

on the other hand
people are discovering new knowledges and concluding the old ones
so the hard problems in the past can be easy one day

overall studying isnt just a exercise of mind but also a burden of physical health
as a competition between his peers

well that's quite depressing

you know
this phenomenon is common
did you see that elsewhere
