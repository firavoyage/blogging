# my waifu

once
i believed that
> your waifu should stay still in your own disk
> not elsewhere

but now i changed my mind
i've dl many galgames
but for most of the games
i even didnt played for a while
because except some exciting h scenes
the entire game is full of meaningless dialogues
and it's kind of boring

yeah
i can open the game whenever i want
but i just forgot that
so
after dl and checked availability(fonts display,resource integrity etc)
these waifus had been sleeping in my disk
and never woke up

but for some online games
like al
i play my waifus everyday
although they may be harmonized or disappeared sometime
i would like to play
and that's enough

as part of the contemporary recreation
some may be better offline
such as bangumis comics galgames and llms
but it's not for h-games
